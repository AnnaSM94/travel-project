            <h3>Leeds, a city at bursting with life and cultural energy</h3>
            <p>
              Yorkshire's unofficial capital. A vibrant metropolis full of
              activity and cultural energy, right in the center of things. A
              thriving artistic community featuring national theater and dance
              organizations that have won awards, a world-class arena with a
              strong independent dining culture that is unique to the area. A
              well-known shopping destination where Victorian arcades and major
              brands coexist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, it serves as a warm host for international athletic
              competitions, vibrant carnivals, and a jam-packed schedule of
              festivals and events. A place that is conveniently accessible by
              car, rail, and air, and a skyline full with magnificent buildings.

                <h4>Whitelock's Ale House</h4>
                <p>
                  Whitelock's received royal approval when Prince George, later
                  Duke of Kent, entertained a party in a curtained-off section
                  of the restaurant in 1912. Whitelock's today continues in its
                  busy role as a pub and eating place.

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  Whitelock's is the very definition of a hidden gem. Step
                  through an unassuming and almost-hidden entrance in the centre
                  of bustling Briggate and under the gilded Whitelock's letters
                  and be magically transported to the splendour of Leeds' finest
                  Victorian pub.
